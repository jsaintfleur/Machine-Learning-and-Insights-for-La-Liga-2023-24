    "# **La Liga 2023/24 Match Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook focuses on analyzing match data from the La Liga 2023/24 season to uncover insights into team performance, match outcomes, and season trends. By processing and enriching the dataset, we aim to provide valuable insights for fans, analysts, and stakeholders in European football.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Source**\n",
    "The dataset includes detailed information about all matches played during the La Liga 2023/24 season. Key fields include:\n",
    "- **Matchday**: The round of the league.\n",
    "- **Match ID**: A unique identifier for each match.\n",
    "- **Teams**: Home and Away teams.\n",
    "- **Scores**: Final scorelines for each match.\n",
    "- **UTC Time**: The date and time of the match in Coordinated Universal Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Objectives**\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:\n",
    "   - Process raw data to extract meaningful insights.\n",
    "   - Split aggregate scores into home and away goals.\n",
    "   - Add relevant columns such as total goals, goal differences, and match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Calculate cumulative goals and points for each team.\n",
    "   - Categorize matches as \"Top Clashes\", \"Relegation Battles\", or \"Regular Matches\".\n",
    "   - Extract temporal features (day of the week, month).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Analyze match outcomes (Home Wins, Away Wins, Draws).\n",
    "   - Identify high-scoring matches and trends by matchday.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Plot distributions of match outcomes and goals.\n",
    "   - Highlight key matches based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features Added**\n",
    "- **Home and Away Scores**: Goals scored by each team in a match.\n",
    "- **Total Goals**: Sum of goals scored in a match.\n",
    "- **Goal Difference**: Difference between home and away goals.\n",
    "- **Match Outcome**: Categorized as Home Win, Away Win, or Draw.\n",
    "- **Cumulative Goals**: Running total of goals scored by teams throughout the season.\n",
    "- **Matchday Average**: Average number of goals scored per matchday.\n",
    "- **Above Matchday Average**: Indicator of matches exceeding the matchday average.\n",
    "- **Match Importance**: Categorization of matches based on team quality and stakes.\n",
    "- **Temporal Features**: Day of the week and month of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Getting Started**\n",
    "This notebook begins with importing the dataset, cleaning the data, and engineering new features. It then proceeds to explore match outcomes and team performance through statistical summaries and visualizations.\n"
