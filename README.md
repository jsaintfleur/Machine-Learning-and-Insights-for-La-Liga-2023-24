## Introduction

This repository explores the 2023/24 La Liga season using player, team, and match performance metrics. From passing accuracy to expected goals (xG) and league standings, it leverages data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to uncover insights into team strengths, player contributions, and match outcomes for football analytics.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides detailed metrics for players and teams, including:

- **Team Metrics**: Passing accuracy, goals scored, goals conceded, possession, interceptions, tackles, and more.
- **Player Metrics**: Expected goals (xG), assists, clean sheets, fouls, cards, and scoring attempts.
- **Match Data**: Scores, match statuses, and league table standings (home, away, overall).
- **Advanced Metrics**: Expected goals, expected assists, expected goals conceded, and possession-based metrics.

This comprehensive dataset serves as a valuable resource for statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning applications in football analytics.

## Project Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Uncover patterns and trends in player and team performances.
   - Identify key factors that influence match outcomes.
   - Visualize data to gain actionable insights.

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Merge multiple CSV files into unified dataframes for player-level and team-level analyses.
   - Address inconsistencies and clean the data for seamless analysis.

3. **Machine Learning Applications**:
   - Develop predictive models to forecast team performance and player contributions.
   - Explore clustering and classification approaches to group teams or players based on performance metrics.

4. **Insights and Reporting**:
   - Provide visualizations and summaries of findings.
   - Create a user-friendly presentation of results for stakeholders and football enthusiasts.
